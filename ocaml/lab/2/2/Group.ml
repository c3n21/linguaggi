(* A group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element. To qualify as a group, the set and the operation must satisfy a few conditions called group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. E.g., the set Z (the integers with sign) with the + operator is a group but with the * is not since inverting the operation break the closure property. *)
